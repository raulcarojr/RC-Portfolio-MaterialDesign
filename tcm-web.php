                The Change Manager is a family service business developed on the premise that helping seniors and their families plan for the future, proactively prepare for the inevitable and communicate in a way that eliminates future confusion, will reduce many of lifeâ€™s stressors and build stronger family units. It is co-owned by Tim Silversides and Randy Brown. <br><br>
                
                I was given the opportunity to connect with them via a reference from one of my previous jobs. Tim and Randy were looking for someone to build a website and set up their social media for their business. I made a very thorough proposal, detailing what kind of services and routes they could take to build their website, as well as how to build their social media accounts. <br><br>
