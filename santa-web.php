                    The Santa Lucia Pizzeria website was a project for my Web Design 2 class. The purpose of this project was to re-design and code a new website, as well as develop new brand guidelines for the business. The logo and the brand guidelines were designed by Zach McCutcheon, while the content and the web design/web development were handled by myself. The website was fully developed using WordPress. <br> <br>
                    The new web site and look for the Santa Lucia Pizzeria website brings the brand to a cleaner and more modern style, compared to the original design of both the logo and the website.  <br> <br>
