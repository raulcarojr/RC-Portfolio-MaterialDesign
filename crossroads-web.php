                    The Crossroads Project was created by a group of Interactive Media Arts instructors in Brandon, Manitoba. This project features content created by the students of the program, while also creating an online community for South Western Manitoba. Itâ€™s a hub of information, culture, and community happenings that help to inform, educate, and bring together those in the community. The website was co-designed and coded with the help of my classmate, Brooke Klinger.
