                <p> The Westoba Wheat Kings Jr. Reporter contest was open to all Manitoba hockey fans between the ages of five to twelve. To enter, Wheat King Fans were encouraged to submit a video of their interviewing skills, showing Westoba why they are the next Westoba Wheat Kings Jr. Reporter. <br><br>

                This contest gave young hockey lovers a chance to enter to win some great prizes, and the opportunity to meet and interview players and staff from the WHL club. <br><br>
                        
                Interviews will be featured on Westoba Credit Unionâ€™s YouTube Channel, wheatkings.com, on the Video Scoreboard at several Brandon home games in 2019-20 as well as all over social media. <br><br>
                        
                The two winners were announced in early November and make their 2019-20 season debuts early in the season.
